What is Java? |Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is designed to be platform-independent, which means Java can run on any device with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).
What are the main features of Java? |Platform independence, object-oriented programming, simple and easy-to-learn syntax, automatic memory management (garbage collection), and a large standard library.
Explain the differences between JDK, JRE and JVM |JVM: JVM also known as Java Virtual Machine is a part of JRE. JVM is a type of interpreter responsible for converting bytecode into machine-readable code. JVM itself is platform dependent but it interprets the bytecode which is the platform-independent reason why Java is platform-independent. JRE: JRE stands for Java Runtime Environment, it is an installation package that provides an environment to run the Java program or application on any machine. JDK: JDK stands for Java Development Kit which provides the environment to develop and execute Java programs. JDK is a package that includes two things Development Tools to provide an environment to develop your Java programs and, JRE to execute Java programs or applications.
What is the difference between an abstract class and an interface? |An abstract class can have both abstract and concrete methods, while an interface can only have abstract methods. A class can implement multiple interfaces but can extend only one abstract class.
What is the significance of the static keyword in Java? |Static is a keyword used so that we can use the element without initiating the class so to avoid the unnecessary allocation of the memory. Create class-level variable and methods.
What is the purpose of the final keyword in Java? |The final keyword is used to indicate that a variable, method or class cannot ne changed or overridden. It provides a level os constancy.
Explain the concept of multithreading in Java |Multithreading allows multiple threads to run concurrently within a single program. Each thread an independent flow of execution.
